        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <div id="rationale">
            <p id="rationaleDesc">The database architecture of the SmartPond System is designed to support efficient, 
                time-based monitoring, storage, retrieval, and analysis of system parameters required for aquaponics operations. 
                The system requires data acquisition from various sensors such as water turbidity sensor, multiple water level
                sensors, pH level sensor, and electric conductivity (EC) or salinity sensor. The system also requires
                inputs such as switching of manual or automatic controls, and
                reviewing of batches through a web-based interface.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                A relational database model is adopted using MariaDB (through XAMPP) to ensure structured data management, 
                fast query processing, and ease of integration with the Flask-based web application. This setup provides the 
                flexibility and scalability required for future expansion, including new sensor types, automation rules, or user profiles.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                The architecture consists of multiple interrelated tables such as:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>SensorData</b> – Stores timestamped readings from all sensors for historical tracking and analysis.</li>
                    <li><b>ActuatorLogs</b> – Records actions taken by the system or user (e.g., pumps turned on/off, lights triggered).</li>
                    <li><b>Users</b> – Holds user credentials and roles for access control.</li>
                    <li><b>Notifications</b> – Logs alerts and scheduled messages (email/SMS) based on system thresholds.</li>
                    <li><b>Settings/Thresholds</b> – Stores user-defined conditions for automation and notification rules.</li>
                    <li><b>Record Archive</b> - where users can view details about past batches and reviews set by other/same users in the past for comparison purposes.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                <br/>
                This structure promotes data normalization, reduces redundancy, and enhances data integrity, 
                which are critical in systems dealing with large volumes of time-series data. Furthermore, 
                using MariaDB allows easy synchronization between backend control logic and user interfaces 
                while supporting real-time updates.
                <br/><br/>
                By centralizing the data architecture, the system can perform 
                intelligent decision-making (e.g., turning on aerators when dissolved oxygen is low), allow 
                historical trend analysis (e.g., growth conditions vs. yield), and provide remote accessibility 
                for end-users, thereby improving productivity and sustainability of the aquaponics system.
